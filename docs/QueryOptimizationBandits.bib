  abstract     = "Programming language processing (similar to natural language
                  processing) is a hot research topic in the field of software
                  engineering; it has also aroused growing interest in the
                  artificial intelligence community. However, different from a
                  natural language sentence, a program contains rich, explicit,
                  and complicated structural information. Hence, traditional
                  NLP models may be inappropriate for programs. In this paper,
                  we propose a novel tree-based convolutional neural network
                  (TBCNN) for programming language processing, in which a
                  convolution kernel is designed over programs' abstract syntax
                  trees to capture structural information. TBCNN is a generic
                  architecture for programming language processing; our
                  experiments show its effectiveness in two different program
                  analysis tasks: classifying programs according to
                  functionality, and detecting code snippets of certain
                  patterns. TBCNN outperforms baseline methods, including
                  several neural models for NLP.",

  abstract  = "Query selection for latent variable estimation is conventionally
               performed by opting for observations with low noise or
               optimizing information theoretic objectives related to reducing
               the level of estimated uncertainty based on the current best
               estimate. In these approaches, typically the system makes a
               decision by leveraging the current available information about
               the state. However, trusting the current best estimate results
               in poor query selection when truth is far from the current
               estimate, and this negatively impacts the speed and accuracy of
               the latent variable estimation procedure. We introduce a novel
               sequential adaptive action value function for query selection
               using the multi-armed bandit (MAB) framework which allows us to
               find a tractable solution. For this adaptive-sequential query
               selection method, we analytically show: (i) performance
               improvement in the query selection for a dynamical system, (ii)
               the conditions where the model outperforms competitors. We also
               present favorable empirical assessments of the performance for
               this method, compared to alternative methods, both using Monte
               Carlo simulations and human-in-the-loop experiments with a brain

                   algorithms that make decisions over time under uncertainty.
                   An enormous body of work has accumulated over the years,
                   covered in several books and surveys. This book provides a
                   more introductory, textbook-like treatment of the subject.
                   Each chapter tackles a particular line of work, providing a
                   self-contained, teachable technical introduction and a brief
                   review of the further developments; many of the chapters
                   conclude with exercises. The book is structured as follows.
                   The first four chapters are on IID rewards, from the basic
                   model to impossibility results to Bayesian priors to
                   Lipschitz rewards. The next three chapters cover adversarial
                   rewards, from the full-feedback version to adversarial
                   bandits to extensions with linear rewards and
                   combinatorially structured actions. Chapter 8 is on
                   contextual bandits, a middle ground between IID and
                   adversarial bandits in which the change in reward
                   distributions is completely explained by observable
                   contexts. The last three chapters cover connections to
                   economics, from learning in repeated games to bandits with
                   supply/budget constraints to exploration in the presence of
                   incentives. The appendix provides sufficient background on
                   concentration and KL-divergence. The chapters on ``bandits
                   with similarity information'', ``bandits with knapsacks''
                   and ``bandits and agents'' can also be consumed as
                   standalone surveys on the respective topics.",
